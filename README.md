# CA North Coast Nature Trails: Mendocino to Ten Mile River 

## Udacity React Neighborhood Map, Project 7 

### Project Description and Purpose:

This is a one page React Map application which displays a list of California North Coast Nature Trails from Mendocino to Ten Mile River. Zooming in will display geolocical elevations for hikers and details on other places of interest.

A sidebar menu shows locations of interest on the map which link to map markers, and a search input field allows the user to filter locations.

The map is generated by the Google Maps API. A second API request is made when a location is clicked to get details about the location, including lattitude, longitude, address and an image.
The location images displayed in the info window are generated by a call to the Flickr API Search endpoint.

The project was built for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.
